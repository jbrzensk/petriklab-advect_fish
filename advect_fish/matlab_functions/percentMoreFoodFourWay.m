function [ percent_more_food_full ] = percentMoreFoodFourWay( Food, neighborhood )
%% This finds food in four directions, and then calculates percentage
%  more food in that direction.
%
% INPUTS:
%   Food    : [m x n] array of prey concentrations [unitless]
%
% OUTPUT:
%   precent_more_food_full : [ m x n x 4] percent more food for each cell
%                                         in the four cardinal directions, 
%                                         up, down, left, and right
%
% TEST : test with the function test_percentMoreFoodFourWay is avail.
